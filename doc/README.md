# Module Notes

Each file in this folder mirrors a Rust module and captures the *current* implementation status:

- What the module is responsible for right now.
- How to call into the existing APIs.
- Known gaps or obvious next steps.

> **Workflow expectation:** when you touch a module, update its companion note so future contributors know what already works. This supplements `PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, which covers the desired end state.
