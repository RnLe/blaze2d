    description: "Not using similarity transform for TE operator (i.e. solving untransformed generalized eigenproblem). Dramatically improved TE convergence and accuracy. Also not using the kernel preconditioner, as it clamps away low-frequency modes that are important for TE convergence. Use the adaptive shift preconditioner instead."
